(defmacro without-interrupts (&body body)
  #!+sb-doc
  "Executes BODY with all deferrable interrupts disabled. Deferrable
interrupts arriving during execution of the BODY take effect after BODY has
been executed.

Deferrable interrupts include most blockable POSIX signals, and
SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD. Does not interfere with garbage collection, and
unlike in many traditional Lisps using userspace threads, in SBCL
WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS does not inhibit scheduling of other threads.

Binds ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS, WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS and WITH-RESTORED-INTERRUPTS
as a local macros.

WITH-RESTORED-INTERRUPTS executes the body with interrupts enabled if and only
if the WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS was in an environment in which interrupts were allowed.

ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS allows the WITH-INTERRUPTS to take effect during the
dynamic scope of its body, unless there is an outer WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS without
a corresponding ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS.

WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS executes its body with interrupts enabled provided that
for there is an ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS for every WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS surrounding
the current one. WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS is equivalent to:

  (allow-with-interrupts (with-interrupts ...))

Care must be taken not to let either ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS or
WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS appear in a function that escapes from inside the
WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS in:

  (without-interrupts
    ;; The body of the lambda would be executed with WITH-INTERRUPTS allowed
    ;; regardless of the interrupt policy in effect when it is called.
    (lambda () (allow-with-interrupts ...)))

  (without-interrupts
    ;; The body of the lambda would be executed with interrupts enabled
    ;; regardless of the interrupt policy in effect when it is called.
    (lambda () (with-local-interrupts ...)))
