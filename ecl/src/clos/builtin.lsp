;;; IMPORTANT!
;;; This class did not exist until now. This was no problem, because it is
;;; not used anywhere in ECL. However, we have to define and we have to
;;; ensure that "T" becomes an instance of BUILT-IN-CLASS.

;;; We have to build the class manually, because
;;;	(ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS NIL ...)
;;; does not work yet, since the class NULL does not exist.
