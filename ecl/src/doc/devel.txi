@ecl{} is an implementation of @clisp{} originally designed for being
@emph{embeddable} into C based applications.  This document describes
the guts of the @ecl{} implementation and how it can cooperate with
code written in other languages, such as C and C++. See
@inforef{Top,,ecl} for details about the @clisp{} implementation and how it
differs from standards.

@chapter Introduction

@ecl{} is an implementation of the @clisp{} language that is based on a kernel
written in C plus a set of libraries written in @clisp{}. The kernel includes a
bytecodes compiler, an interpreter, and enough functions to create and
manipulate all lisp objects. The lisp libraries provide higher level constructs
such as macro definitions, LOOPs, an implementation of CLOS, and a translator
from Lisp to C.

As a result of this design, which dates back to the Kyoto CL and was later
improved in Giuseppe Attardi's ECoLisp, @ecl{} can be used as
@itemize
@item As a standalone implementation of the @clisp{} language
@item As an embedded interpreter subject to the control of a larger C program.
@item As a @clisp{} environment with C/C++ extensions.
@end itemize
@noindent
This manual describes the facility of @ecl{} to interface the C language and
@ecl{}.  With this facility, the user can arrange his or her C-language
programs so that they can be invoked from @ecl{}. In addition, the user can
write Lisp function definitions in the C language to increase runtime
efficiency.

@node What can ECL do?, Compiling files, Building programs, Building programs
@section What can @ecl{} do?

Some day for some reasons you will be in the need to distribute code that
has been developed using @ecl{}. In the following sections we will describe
the means that @ecl{} offers you to do so. Basically, these are the
alternatives

@table @sc
@item Source code
You distribute your programs in source code form. This is the easiest and most
portable way, but not the fastest one.
@item Standalone programs
You translate all your lisp code to C using the @ecl{} compiler. The final
object files can be linked against other C/C++ libraries to obtain a standalone
executable.
@item You can build statically and dynamically linked libraries.
You translate all your lisp code to C and combine the resulting object files
into a single library with @file{.a} extension. You can distribute this library
to other people and the final users can utilize these libraries to build
standalone programs.
@item You can build dynamically loadable files.
This is the most flexible way. You translate all lisp code to C and link it
against possibly other C/C++ libraries to obtain a dynamically loadable library
(file type @file{.so} under unix). This library can be loaded a startup time to
add new functionality to the @ecl{} environment.
@end table

In several of these options, we have mentioned the possibility to include C/C++
code. Even if this is possible, you cannot use ordinary C/C++ compilers and
makefiles to build @ecl{} extensions, let it be programs or
libraries. Briefly, you have to organize your code as follows
@enumerate
@item Organize the C code as a library, let it be static or dynamic.
@item Build a function, say @code{mymain()}, in which the initialization phase
for your library is performed.
@item Group the code that interfaces to Lisp in separate C files, all of which
should include @code{#include <ecl/ecl.h>} at the beginning.
@item Compile your lisp source files.
@item Let @ecl{} build the final executable or library.
@end enumerate
@noindent
In the final step there are ways to instruct @ecl{} to call your
initialization function (@code{mymain()} in the example above). These means
are explained in the following sections.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Compiling files, Building standalone executables, What can ECL do?, Building programs
@section Compiling files

@ecl{} supports two types of compilation. One is bytecodes compilation. This
process is performed on-the-fly, as you load source files with lisp code. This
leads to a series of bytes for each instruction, the so called
"bytecodes". These bytecodes are interpreted in a virtual machine, which is
written in C and which is reasonably fast.

The other type of compilation is the so-called "native" compilation. This
process consists on translating the lisp source file to C language. The
intermediate file is later compiled using a C compiler. The result is an object
file which may have different purposes.

@table @sc
@item Dynamically loadable files or FASL (FASt Loadable) files
These are produced in a @ecl{} built with support for dynamically loadable
libraries (Feature @kwd{DLOPEN} is in @var{*features*}), when no extra
arguments are passed to @code{compile-file}. These object files typically have
the @file{.fas} extension, and can be loaded with @code{load}. They cannot be used
to build libraries nor standalone executable programs.

@item linkable object files
These are produced when invoking @code{compile-file} with the keyword argument
@kwd{system-p} set to true. The object file typically has the @file{.o}
extension. It cannot be loaded with @code{load}, but it can be used to build
libraries, standalone executable programs, or larger FASL files.
@end table

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Building standalone executables, Building libraries, Compiling files, Building programs
@section Building standalone executables

To build an executable you need a working @ecl{} image with the
compiler. The function to build customized images is
@var{c::build-program}. The description of this function is as
follows. Care should be taken that @var{image-name} differs from any
filename in @var{lisp-files}.

@defun {c:build-program} @{@var{image-name} @keys{} @var{lisp-files} @var{ld-flags} @var{prologue-code} @var{epilogue-code}@}

This function builds a lisp image up from the core lisp library, plus all
components listed in @var{lisp-files}.  Each component is either:
@itemize
@item A symbol: Names a statically linked library built from lisp code.
@item A string: Denotes an object file built from lisp code.
@end itemize
@noindent
@var{ld-flags} is a list of strings with additional parameters to be passed
to the linker. You can include here your favorite C/C++ libraries.

@var{prologue-code} and @var{epilogue-code} are used to customize the
initialization process of the lisp image.  In order to build the executable,
@var{c:build-program} first writes down a piece of C code which initializes the
lisp environment. You can customize the initialization process by suppling code
to be executed before (@var{prologue-code}) or after (@var{epilogue-code})
setting up the lisp environment. Typically @var{prologue-code} defaults to an
empty string, while @var{epilogue-code} invokes the classical lisp
@var{top-level}. Additionally, as a convenience, @var{epilogue-code} can
be either a string with C code or also a list with a lisp form, which
will be interpreted at run time.
@end defun

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Building libraries, File names, Building standalone executables, Building programs
@section Building libraries

To build a library you proceed more or less the same way as with standalone
executables. There are two different functions depending on whether you need
to build static or shared libraries.

@defun {c:build-static-library} @{@var{library-name} @keys{} @var{lisp-files} @var{prologue-code} @var{epilogue-code} @var{init-name}@}
@defunx {c:build-shared-library} @{@var{library-name} @keys{} @var{lisp-files} @var{prologue-code} @var{epilogue-code} @var{ld-flags} @var{init-name}@}

This function builds a library file up from the object files listed in
@var{lisp-files}. Each of the arguments to @var{lisp-file} must name a single
object file produced with @code{compile-file}.

@var{library-name} is the physical pathname corresponding to the library. The
value of @var{library-name} must follow some system-specific conventions.  To
make your program portable, @var{library-name} should be built using the
output of @code{compile-file-pathname}.

@var{prologue-code} and @var{epilogue-code} are strings with C code to be
executed before and after initializing the library, respectively. For
dynamically linked libraries you can also provide a list of strings in 
@var{ld-flags}. These strings are additional parameters for the linker and
their purpose is to link C/C++ extensions into the library.

@var{init-name} gives the initialization function of the library a
user-specified name. Thus a the generated library may be used and/or
linked to a C application.
@end defun

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@node File names, Compiler examples, Building libraries, Building programs
@section File names

@defun {compile-file-pathname} @{@var{filename-base} @keys{} @var{output-file} @var{type}@}

When compiling lisp files, creating libraries, etc, a number of files are
produced which are of interest for the user or programmer. However, the name
of these files will change from system to system. The purpose of the function
@code{compile-file-pathname} is to query the compiler about the name of the
different files that it can produce. Possible values of the @var{type}
argument include:

@table @sc
@item :fas (default)
Standard compiled files that can be loaded with @code{load}.
@item :c, :data, :h
Intermediate files produced by the Lisp-to-C translator.
@item :o
Linkable object files.
@item :lib, :static-library
A normal library produced with @code{c:build-static-library}.
@item :dll, :shared-library
A dynamically linked library produced with @code{c:build-shared-library}.
@item :program
An executable produced with @code{c:build-program}.
@end table

The output of this function is system specific. For example, under FreeBSD
@smallformat
> (compile-file-pathname "/this/path/mylib" :type :lib)
#P"/this/path/libmylib.a"
> (compile-file-pathname "/this/path/mylib" :type :dll)

> (compile-file-pathname "/this/path/mycode")
#P"/this/path/mycode.fas"

@section Compiler examples

@subsection The @file{hello.lisp} file
In the following examples we will use the same lisp program. You have to
create a file called @file{hello.lisp} which contains the following lines
@lisp
(princ "Hello world!")
(terpri)
(quit)
@end lisp
@noindent
If you start @ecl{} and load this file in the Common-Lisp environment you
will see the @code{"Hello world!"} message and the interpreter will be closed.

@subsection Example of loadable object file
You can only perform the example in this section if your @ecl{} image supports
dynamically loading of object files. This is true if you find the keyword
@kwd{dlopen} in the @var{*features*} variable. This is true, for instance,
in a typical FreeBSD or Linux box,

@end smallformat

In this example we build a loadable extension which prints the @code{"Hello
world!"} message. First you need to create a the @file{hello.lisp} file. Next
you have to enter the @ecl{} environment and type @code{(compile-file
"hello.lisp")}. This produces a loadable object file.

@smallformat

@end smallformat

@subsection Example of standalone program
In this example we build a standalone program which prints the @code{"Hello
world!"} message and does nothing else. First you must create the
@file{hello.lisp} file shown above. Next you have to enter the @ecl{}
environment and type @code{(compile-file "hello.lisp" :system-p t)}. This
produces an object file that can be linked against the @ecl{} core image.

@smallformat
Type :h for Help.  Top level.

;;; Loading #P"/usr/lib/ecl/cmp.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/usr/lib/ecl/sysfun.lsp"

;;; End of Pass 1.  
;;; Calling the C compiler...

;;; OPTIMIZE levels: Safety=2, Space=0, Speed=3
;;; Finished compiling hello.lisp.
#P"hello.o"
@end smallformat

@noindent
The final step is to build the executable using the @code{c:build-program}
instruction.
@smallformat
> @b{(c:build-program "myecl" :lisp-files '("hello.o"))}
;;; Invoking external command: gcc -O2 -march=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -fPIC -fstrict-aliasing -Dlinux -O "-I/usr/lib/ecl/" -w -c "myecl.c" -o "myecl.o"

#P"myecl"
Top level.
@end smallformat
@noindent
Now you can execute this program from your favorite shell.

@smallformat
% @b{./myecl}
Hello world!
@end smallformat

@subsection Combining files into a larger FASL
You can only perform the example in this section if your @ecl{} image supports
dynamically loading of object files. In this example we build a loadable
library which prints the @code{"Hello world!"} message and does nothing
else. First you must create the @file{hello.lisp} file shown above. Next you
have to enter the @ecl{} environment and type @code{(compile-file "hello.lisp"
:system-p t)}. This produces an object file that can be linked to form a loadable
library.

@smallformat
Type :h for Help.  Top level.
> (compile-file "hello.lisp" :system-p t)
;;; Loading #P"/usr/lib/ecl/cmp.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/usr/lib/ecl/sysfun.lsp"
;;; Compiling hello.lisp.
;;; End of Pass 1.  
;;; Calling the C compiler... 
;;; Invoking external command: gcc -O2 -march=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -fPIC -fstrict-aliasing -Dlinux -O "-I/usr/lib/ecl/" -w -c "hello.c" -o "hello.o"
;;; OPTIMIZE levels: Safety=2, Space=0, Speed=3
;;; Finished compiling hello.lisp.
#P"hello.o"
@end smallformat

@noindent
The final step is to build the library using the @code{c:build-fasl}
instruction.
@smallformat
> (c:build-fasl "myecl" :lisp-files '("hello.o"))
;;; Invoking external command: gcc -O2 -march=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -fPIC -fstrict-aliasing -Dlinux -O "-I/usr/lib/ecl/" -w -c "myecl.c" -o "myecl.o"

@node Objects representation, Constructing objects, Lisp objects, Lisp objects
@section Objects representation

In @ecl{} a lisp object is represented by a type called @code{cl_object}. This
type is a word which is long enough to host both an integer and a pointer. The
least significant bits of this word, also called the tag bits, determine
whether it is a pointer to a C structure representing a complex object, or
whether it is an immediate data, such as a fixnum or a character.
@verbatim
	|-------------------|--| 
	|    Fixnum value   |01|
	|-------------------|--| 

	|------------|------|--| 
	| Unused bits| char |10|
	|------------|------|--| 

	|----------------------|     |--------|--------|-----|--------|
	|    Pointer to cell   |---->| word-1 | word-2 | ... | word-n |
	|----------------------|     |--------|--------|-----|--------|
	| ...................00|     |    actual data of the object   |
	|----------------------|     |--------------------------------|
@end verbatim

The fixnums and characters are called immediate datatypes, because they require
no more than the @code{cl_object} datatype to store all information.  All other
@ecl{} objects are non-immediate and they are represented by a pointer to a
cell that is allocated on the heap.  Each cell consists of several words of
memory and contains all the information related to that object. By storing data
in multiples of a word size, we make sure that the least significant bits of a
pointer are zero, which distinguishes pointers from immediate data.

In an immediate datatype, the tag bits determine the type of the object. In
non-immediate datatypes, the first byte in the cell contains the secondary type
indicator, and distinguishes between different types of non immediate data. The
use of the remaining bytes differs for each type of object.  For instance, a
cons cell consists of three words:
@verbatim
	|---------|----------| 
	|CONS|    |          |
	|---------|----------| 
	|     car-pointer    |
	|--------------------| 
	|     cdr-pointer    |
	|--------------------| 
@end verbatim

There is one important function which tells the type of an object, plus several
macros which group several tests.

@deftp {C type} cl_object
This is the type of a lisp object. For your C/C++ program, a @code{cl_object}
can be either a fixnum, a character, or a pointer to a union of structures (See
the header @file{object.h}). The actual interpretation of that object can be
guessed with the macro @code{type_of}.

For example, if @var{x} is of type @code{cl_object}, and it is of type fixnum,
we may retrieve its value
@example
if (type_of(x) == t_fixnum)
       	printf("Integer value: %d\n", fix(x));
@end example
@noindent
If @var{x} is of type @code{cl_object} and it does not contain an immediate
datatype, you may inspect the cell associated to the lisp object using @var{x}
as a pointer. For example,
@example
if (type_of(x) == t_cons)
        printf("CAR = %x, CDR = %x\n", x->cons.car, x->cons.cdr);
else if (type_of(x) == t_string)
        printf("String: %s\n", x->string.self);
@end example
@noindent
You should see the following sections and the header @file{object.h} to learn
how to use the different fields of a @code{cl_object} pointer.
@end deftp

@deftp {C type} cl_type
Enumeration type which distinguishes the different types of lisp objects.  The
most important values are t_cons, t_fixnum, t_character, t_bignum, t_ratio,
t_singlefloat, t_doublefloat, t_complex, t_symbol, t_package, t_hashtable,
t_array, t_vector, t_string, t_bitvector, t_stream, t_random, t_readtable,
t_pathname, t_bytecodes, t_cfun, t_cclosure, t_gfun, t_instance, t_foreign and
t_thread.
@end deftp

@deftypefun cl_type type_of (cl_object @var{O})
If @var{O} is a valid lisp object, @code{type_of(@var{O})} returns an integer
denoting the type that lisp object. That integer is one of the values of the
enumeration type @code{cl_type}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun bool FIXNUMP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool CHARACTERP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool CONSP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool LISTP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool ATOM (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool ARRAYP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool VECTORP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool STRINGP (cl_object @var{o})

Different macros that check whether @var{o} belongs to the specified type.
These checks have been optimized, and are preferred over several calls to
@code{type_of}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun bool IMMEDIATE (cl_object @var{o})
Tells whether @var{o} is an immediate datatype.
@end deftypefun

@node Constructing objects, Integers, Objects representation, Lisp objects
@section Constructing objects

On each of the following sections we will document the standard interface for
building objects of different types. For some objects, though, it is too
difficult to make a C interface that resembles all of the functionality in the
lisp environment. In those cases you need to

@enumerate
@item build the objects from their textual representation, or
@item use the evaluator to build these objects.
@end enumerate
@noindent
The first way makes use of a C or Lisp string to construct an object. The two
functions you need to know are the following ones.

@deftypefun cl_object c_string_to_object (const char *@var{s})
@deftypefunx cl_object string_to_object (cl_object @var{o})
@code{c_string_to_object} builds a lisp object from a C string which contains a
suitable representation of a lisp object. @code{string_to_object} performs the
same task, but uses a lisp string, and therefore it is less useful. Two
examples of their use

@example
/* Using a C string */
cl_object array1 = c_string_to_object("#(1 2 3 4)");

/* Using a Lisp string */
cl_object string = make_simple_string("#(1 2 3 4)");
cl_object array2 = string_to_object(string);
@end example
@end deftypefun

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Integers, Characters, Constructing objects, Lisp objects
@section Integers

@clisp{} distinguishes two types of integer types: bignums and fixnums. A
fixnum is a small integer, which ideally occupies only a word of memory and
which is between the values @var{MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM} and
@var{MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM}. A bignum is any integer which is not a fixnum and
it is only constrained by the amount of memory available to represent it.

In @ecl{} a fixnum is an integer that, together with the tag bits, fits in a
word of memory. The size of a word, and thus the size of a fixnum, varies from
one architecture to another, and you should refer to the types and constants in
the @file{ecl.h} header to make sure that your C extensions are portable.
All other integers are stored as bignums, they are not immediate objects, they
take up a variable amount of memory and the GNU Multiprecision Library is
required to create, manipulate and calculate with them.

@deftp {C type} cl_fixnum
This is a C signed integer type capable of holding a whole fixnum without any
loss of precision. The opposite is not true, and you may create a
@code{cl_fixnum} which exceeds the limits of a fixnum and should be stored as a
bignum.
@end deftp

@deftp {C type} cl_index
This is a C unsigned integer type capable of holding a nonnegative fixnum without
loss of precision. Typically, a @code{cl_index} is used as an index into an array,
or into a proper list, etc.
@end deftp

@defvr {Constant} MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM
@defvrx {Constant} MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM
These constants mark the limits of a fixnum.
@end defvr

@deftypefun bool FIXNUM_MINUSP (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx bool FIXNUM_PLUSP (cl_object @var{o})
These functions perform the checks (@var{o} < 0) and (0 <= @var{o}),
respectively.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object MAKE_FIXNUM (cl_fixnum @var{n})
@deftypefunx cl_fixnum fix (cl_object @var{o})

@code{MAKE_FIXNUM} and @code{fix} convert from an integer to a lisp object
of fixnum type and vice versa. These functions no not check their arguments.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_fixnum fixint (cl_object @var{o})
Converts a lisp fixnum to a C integer of the appropriate size. Signals an error
if @var{o} is not of fixnum type.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_index fixnnint (cl_object @var{o})
Similar to @code{fixint} but also ensures that @var{o} is not negative.
@end deftypefun

@node Characters, Arrays, Integers, Lisp objects
@section Characters

@ecl{} has only one type of characters, which fits in the C type @code{char}.
The following constants and functions operate on characters.

@defvr {Constant} CHAR_CODE_LIMIT
Each character is assigned an integer code which ranges from 0 to
(@var{CHAR_CODE_LIMIT}-1).
@end defvr

@deftypefun cl_fixnum CHAR_CODE (cl_object @var{o})
@deftypefunx cl_fixnum char_code (cl_object @var{o})
Returns the integer code associated to a lisp character. Only @code{char_code}
checks its arguments.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object CODE_CHAR (cl_fixnum @var{o})
Returns the lisp character associated to an integer code. It does not check
its arguments.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object coerce_to_character (cl_object @var{o})
Coerces a lisp object to type character. Valid arguments are a character,
or a string designator of length 1. In all other cases an error is signaled.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun bool char_eq (cl_object @var{x}, cl_object @var{y})
@deftypefunx bool char_equal (cl_object @var{x}, cl_object @var{y})
Compare two characters for equality. @code{char_eq} take case into account and
@code{char_equal} ignores it.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int char_cmp (cl_object @var{x}, cl_object @var{y})
@deftypefunx int char_compare (cl_object @var{x}, cl_object @var{y})
Compare the relative order of two characters. @code{char_cmp} takes care of
case and @code{char_compare} converts all characters to uppercase before
comparing them.
@end deftypefun

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Arrays, Strings, Characters, Lisp objects
@section Arrays

An array is an aggregate of data of a common type, which can be accessed with
one or more nonnegative indices. @ecl{} stores arrays as a C structure with a
pointer to the region of memory which contains the actual data. The cell
of an array datatype varies depending on whether it is a vector, a bytevector,
a multidimensional array or a string.

If @var{x} contains a vector, you can access the following fields:
@table @code
@item x->vector.elttype
The type of the elements of the vector.
@item x->vector.dim
The maximum number of elements.
@item x->vector.fillp
Actual number of elements in the vector or "fill pointer".
@item x->vector.self
Union of pointers of different types. You should choose the right pointer
depending on @code{x->vector.elltype}
@item x->vector.hasfillp
Whether @code{x->vector.fillp} can be smaller than @code{x->vector.dim}.
@end table

If @var{x} contains a multidimensional array, the cell elements become
@table @code
@item x->array.elttype
The type of the elements of the array.
@item x->array.dim
Number of elements in the array.
@item x->array.rank
Number of dimensions of the array.
@item x->array.dims[]
Array with the dimensions of the array. The elements range from
@code{x->array.dim[0]} to @code{x->array.dim[x->array.rank-1]}.
@item x->array.self
Union of pointers to the actual data. You should choose the right pointer
depending on @code{x->array.elltype}.
@item x->array.rank
Whether @code{x->vector.fillp} can be smaller than @code{x->vector.dim}.
@end table
@noindent
Bitvectors and strings are treated separately.

Each array is of an specialized type which is the type of the elements of the
array. @ecl{} has arrays only a few following specialized types, and for each
of these types there is a C integer which is the corresponding value of
@code{x->array.elttype} or @code{x->vector.elttype}. We list those types
together with the C constant that denotes that type:
@table @var
@item T
@code{aet_object}
@item CHARACTER
@code{aet_ch}
@item FIXNUM
@code{aet_fix}
@item BIT
@code{aet_bit}
@item SINGLE-FLOAT
@code{aet_sf}
@item DOUBLE-FLOAT
@code{aet_df}
@end table

@deftypefun cl_elttype array_elttype (cl_object @var{o})
Returns the element type of the array @var{o}, which can be a string, a
bitvector, vector, or a multidimensional array. For example, the code
@code{array_elttype(c_string_to_object("\"AAA\""))} returns @code{aet_ch},
while the @code{array_elttype(c_string_to_object("#(A B C)"))} returns
@code{aet_object}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object aref (cl_object @var{array}, cl_index @var{index})
@deftypefunx cl_object aset (cl_object @var{array}, cl_index @var{index}, cl_object @var{value})
These functions are used to retrieve and set the elements of an array. The
elements are accessed with one index, @var{index}, as in the lisp function
@code{ROW-MAJOR-AREF}. For example

@example
cl_object array = c_string_to_object("#2A((1 2) (3 4))");
cl_object x = aref(array, 3);
cl_print(1, x);	/* Outputs 4 */
aset(array, 3, MAKE_FIXNUM(5));
cl_print(1, array); /* Outputs #2A((1 2) (3 5)) */
@end example
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object aref1 (cl_object @var{vector}, cl_index @var{index})
@deftypefunx cl_object aset1 (cl_object @var{vector}, cl_index @var{index}, cl_object @var{value})
These functions are similar to @code{aref} and @code{aset}, but they operate on
vectors.
@example
cl_object array = c_string_to_object("#(1 2 3 4)");
cl_object x = aref1(array, 3);
cl_print(1, x);	/* Outputs 4 */
aset1(array, 3, MAKE_FIXNUM(5));
cl_print(1, array); /* Outputs #(1 2 3 5) */
@end example
@end deftypefun

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Strings, Bitvectors, Arrays, Lisp objects
@section Strings

A string, both in @clisp{} and in @ecl{} is nothing but a vector of
characters. Therefore, almost everything mentioned in the section of arrays
remains valid here. The only important difference is that @ecl{} stores
strings as a lisp object with a pointer to a zero terminated C string. Thus, if
a string has @var{n} characters, @ecl{} will reserve @var{n}+1 bytes for the
string. This allows us to pass the string @code{self} pointer to any C
routine.

If @var{x} is a lisp object of type string, we can access the following fields:
@table @code
@item x->string.dim
Maximum number of characters that it can contain.
@item x->string.fillp
Actual number of characters in the string.
@item x->string.self
Pointer to the characters.
@item x->string.hasfillp
True if @code{x->string.fillp} can be smaller than @code{x->string.dim}.
@end table

@deftypefun cl_object make_simple_string (char *@var{s})
@deftypefunx cl_object make_string_copy (char *@var{s})
Both routines build a lisp string from a C string. @code{make_string_copy}
allocates new space and copies the content of the string to
it. @code{make_simple_string} simply uses the memory pointed by @var{s}, which
should not be deallocated. Both routines use @code{strlen} to calculate the
length of the string.

@section Bytecodes

A bytecodes object is a lisp object with a piece of code that can be
interpreted. The objects of type @code{t_bytecode} are implicitly constructed
by a call to @code{eval}, but can also be explicitly constructed with the
@code{make_lambda} function.

@deftypefun cl_object cl_safe_eval (cl_object @var{form}, cl_object @var{env}, cl_object @var{err_value}
@deftypefunx cl_object cl_eval (cl_object @var{form})

@code{cl_safe_eval} evaluates @var{form} in the lexical environment @var{env},
which can be @var{nil}. Before evaluating it, the expression @var{form} must
be bytecompiled. @code{cl_eval} is the equivalent of @code{cl_safe_eval} but
without environment and with @var{err_value} set to @var{nil}. It exists only
for compatibility with previous versions.
@example
cl_object form = c_string_to_object("(print 1)");
cl_safe_eval(form,Cnil);
cl_safe_eval(form, Cnil);
@end example
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun cl_object si_make_lambda (cl_object @var{name}, cl_object @var{def})
Builds an interpreted lisp function with name given by the symbol @var{name}
and body given by @var{def}. For instance, we would achieve the equivalent of
@lisp
(funcall #'(lambda (x y) (block foo (+ x y)))
         1 2)
@end lisp
@noindent
with the following code
@example
cl_object def = c_string_to_object("((x y) (+ x y))");
cl_object name = _intern("foo")
cl_object fun = si_make_lambda(name, def);
return funcall(fun, MAKE_FIXNUM(1), MAKE_FIXNUM(2));
@end example
@noindent Notice that @code{si_safe_lambda} performs a bytecodes compilation
of the definition and thus it may signal some errors. Such errors are not
handled by the routine itself you might consider using @code{cl_safe_eval}
or @code{cl_eval} instead:
@example
cl_object def = c_string_to_object("#'(lambda-block foo (x y) (+ x y))");
cl_object fun = cl_eval(def);
return funcall(fun, MAKE_FIXNUM(1), MAKE_FIXNUM(2));

@section @ecl{} stacks

@ecl{} uses the following stacks:

@table @sc
@item Frame Stack
consisting of catch, block, tagbody frames

@item Bind Stack
for shallow binding of dynamic variables

@item Interpreter Stack
acts as a Forth data stack, keeping intermediate arguments to
interpreted functions, plus a history of called functions.

@item C Control Stack
used for arguments/values passing, typed lexical variables,
temporary values, and function invocation.
@end table


@node Procedure Call Conventions, The lexical environment, ECL stacks, The interpreter
@section Procedure Call Conventions
 
@ecl{} employs standard C calling conventions to achieve efficiency and
interoperability with other languages.
Each Lisp function is implemented as a C function which takes as many
argument as the Lisp original plus one additional integer argument
which holds the number of actual arguments.  The function sets @code{NValues}
to the number of Lisp values produced, it returns the first one and the
remaining ones are kept in  a global (per thread) array (@code{VALUES}).

To show the argument/value passing mechanism, here we list the actual
code for the @clisp{} function @code{cons}.

@example
cl_cons(int narg, object car, object cdr)
@{       object x;
        check_arg(2);
        x = alloc_object(t_cons);
        CAR(x) = car;
        CDR(x) = cdr;
        NValues = 1;
        return x;
@}
@end example

@ecl{} adopts the convention that the name of a function that implements a
@clisp{} function begins with a short package name (@code{cl} for COMMON-LISP,
@code{si} for SYSTEM, etc), followed by @code{L}, and followed by the name of
the @clisp{} function.  (Strictly speaking, `@code{-}' and `@code{*}' in the
@clisp{} function name are replaced by `@code{_}' and `@code{A}', respectively,
to obey the syntax of C.)

@code{check_arg(2)} in the code of @code{cl_cons} checks that exactly two
arguments are supplied to @code{cons}.  That is, it checks that @code{narg} is
2, and otherwise, it causes an error.  @code{allocate_object(t_cons)} allocates
a cons cell in the heap and returns the pointer to the cell.  After the
@code{CAR} and the @code{CDR} fields of the cell are set, the cell pointer is
returned directly. The number assigned to NValues set by the function (1 in
this case) represents the number of values of the function.

In general, if one is to play with the C kernel of @ecl{} there is no need to
know about all these conventions. There is a preprocessor that takes care of
the details, by using a lisp representation of the statements that output
values, and of the function definitions. For instance, the actual source code
for @code{cl_cons} in @file{src/c/lists.d}

@example
@@(defun cons (car cdr)
@@
        @@(return CONS(car, cdr))
@@)
@end example

@node The lexical environment, The interpreter stack, Procedure Call Conventions, The interpreter
@section The lexical environment

The @ecl{} interpreter uses two A-lists (Association lists) to
represent lexical environments.

@itemize
@item One for variable bindings
@item One for local function/macro/tag/block bindings
@end itemize

When a function closure is created, the current two A-lists are
saved in the closure along with the lambda expression.  Later, when the
closure is invoked, the saved A-lists are
used to recover the lexical environment.


@node The interpreter stack,  , The lexical environment, The interpreter
@section The interpreter stack
 
The bytecodes interpreter uses a stack of its own to save and restore values
from intermediate calculations. This Forth-like data stack is also used in
other parts of the C kernel for various purposes, such as saving compiled code,
keeping arguments to FORMAT, etc.

However, one of the most important roles of the Interpreter Stack is to keep a
log of the functions which are called during the execution of bytecodes. For
each function invoked, the interpreter keeps three lisp objects on the stack:
@verbatim
    +----------+------------------------------------------------+
    | function | lexical environment | index to previous record |
    +----------+---------------------+--------------------------+
@end verbatim

The first item is the object which is funcalled. It can be a bytecodes object,
a compiled function or a generic function. In the last two cases the lexical
environment is just NIL. In the first case, the second item on the stack is
the lexical environment on which the code is executed. Each of these records
are popped out of the stack after function invocation.

Let us see how these invocation records are used for debugging.

@section The compiler translates to C

The @ecl{} compiler is essentially a translator from @clisp{} to C.  Given
a Lisp source file, the compiler first generates three intermediate
files:

@itemize
@item a C-file which consists of the C version of the Lisp program
@item an H-file which consists of declarations referenced in the C-file
@item a Data-file which consists of Lisp data to be used at load time
@end itemize

The @ecl{} compiler then invokes the C compiler to compile the
C-file into an object file.  Finally, the contents of the Data-file is
appended to the object file to make a @emph{Fasl-file}.  The generated
Fasl-file can be loaded into the @ecl{} system by the @clisp{}
function @code{load}.  By default, the three intermediate files are
deleted after the compilation, but, if asked, the compiler leaves
them.

The merits of the use of C as the intermediate language are:

@itemize -
@item The @ecl{} compiler is highly portable.

@item Cross compilation is possible, because the contents of the
intermediate files are common to all versions of @ecl{}.  For example,
one can compile his or her Lisp program by the @ecl{} compiler on
a Sun, bring the intermediate files to DOS, compile the C-file with
the gcc compiler under DOS, and then append the Data-file to the object
file.  This procedure generates the Fasl-file for the @ecl{} system on
DOS.  This kind of cross compilation makes it easier to port @ecl{}.

@item Hardware-dependent optimizations such as register allocations
are done by the C compiler.
@end itemize

The demerits are:

@itemize -
@item  At those sites where no C compiler is available,
the users cannot compile their Lisp programs.

@item The compilation time is long.  70% to 80% of the
compilation time is used by the C compiler.  The @ecl{} compiler is
therefore slower than compiler generating machine code directly.
@end itemize

@node The compiler mimics human C programmer, Implementation of Compiled Closures, The compiler translates to C, The compiler
@section The compiler mimics human C programmer
 
The format of the intermediate C code generated by the @ecl{} compiler is the
same as the hand-coded C code of the @ecl{} source programs.  For example,
supposing that the Lisp source file contains the
following function definition:

@lisp
(defvar *delta* 2)
(defun add1 (x) (+ *delta* x))
@end lisp

@noindent
The compiler generates the following intermediate C code.

@example
/*	function definition for ADD1                                  */
static cl_object L1(cl_object V1)
@{ VT2 VLEX2 CLSR2
	cl_object value0;
	value0=number_plus(symbol_value(VV[0]),V1); NVALUES=1;
	return value0;
@}
/*      initialization of this module                                 */
void init_CODE(cl_object flag)
@{ VT1 CLSR1
	cl_object value0;
	if (!FIXNUMP(flag))@{
	Cblock=flag;
	#ifndef ECL_DYNAMIC_VV
	flag->cblock.data = VV;
	#endif
	flag->cblock.self_destruct=0;
	flag->cblock.data_size = VM;
	flag->cblock.data_text = compiler_data_text;
	flag->cblock.data_text_size = compiler_data_text_size;
	return;@}
	#ifdef ECL_DYNAMIC_VV
	VV = Cblock->cblock.data;
	#endif
	T0= MAKE_FIXNUM(2);
	si_Xmake_special(VV[0])
        if(SYM_VAL(T0)!=OBJNULL) cl_setq(VV[0],T0);
	cl_def_c_function(VV[1],(void*)L1,1);
@}
@end example

The C function @code{L1} implements the Lisp function @code{add1}.
This relation is established by @code{cl_def_c_function} in the
initialization function @code{init_CODE}, which is invoked at load
time.  There, the vector @code{VV} consists of Lisp objects;
@code{VV[0]} and @code{VV[1]} in this example hold the Lisp symbols
@code{*delta*} and @code{add1}. @code{VM} in the definition of
@code{L1} is a C macro declared in the corresponding H-file.  The
actual value of @code{VM} is the number of value stack locations used
by this module, i.e., 2 in this example.  Thus the following macro
definition is found in the H-file.
@example
#define VM 2
@end example


@node Implementation of Compiled Closures, Use of Declarations to Improve Efficiency, The compiler mimics human C programmer, The compiler
@section Implementation of Compiled Closures
 
The @ecl{} compiler takes two passes before it invokes the C
compiler.  The major role of the first pass is to detect function
closures and to detect, for each function closure, those lexical
objects (i.e., lexical variable, local function definitions, tags, and
block-names) to be enclosed within the closure.  This check must be
done before the C code generation in the second pass, because lexical
objects to be enclosed in function closures are treated in a different
way from those not enclosed.

Ordinarily, lexical variables in a compiled function @emph{f}
are allocated on the C stack.  However, if a lexical variable is
to be enclosed in function closures, it is allocated on a list, called
the ``environment list'', which is local to @emph{f}.  In addition, a
local variable is created which points to the lexical
variable's location (within the environment list), so that
the variable may be accessed through an indirection rather than by list
traversal.

@ignore
\bf{Rewrite this}
@end ignore

The environment list is a pushdown list: It is empty when @emph{f} is called.
An element is pushed on the environment list when a variable to be enclosed in
closures is bound, and is popped when the binding is no more in effect.  That
is, at any moment during execution of @emph{f}, the environment list contains
those lexical variables whose binding is still in effect and which should be
enclosed in closures.  When a compiled closure is created during execution of
@emph{f}, the compiled code for the closure is coupled with the environment
list at that moment to form the compiled closure.

Later, when the compiled closure is invoked, a pointer is set up to each
lexical variable in the environment list, so that each object may be referenced
through a memory indirection.

Let us see an example.  Suppose the following function has been compiled.

@lisp
(defun foo (x)
    (let ((a #'(lambda () (incf x)))
          (y x))

@code{foo} returns two compiled closures.  The first closure increments @var{x}
by one, whereas the second closure increments @var{x} by the initial value of
@var{x}.  Both closures return the incremented value of @var{x}.

@section Use of Declarations to Improve Efficiency

Declarations, especially  type  and  function  declarations,
increase the efficiency of the compiled code.  For example, for the
following Lisp source file, with two @clisp{} declarations added,

@lisp
(eval-when (compile)
  (proclaim '(function tak (fixnum fixnum fixnum) fixnum))

(defun tak (x y z)
  (declare (fixnum x y z))
  (if (not (< y x))
      z
      (tak (tak (1- x) y z)
           (tak (1- y) z x)
           (tak (1- z) x y))))
@end lisp

The compiler generates the following C code:

@example
/*      local entry for function TAK                                  */
static int LI1(register int V1,register int V2,register int V3)
@{ VT3 VLEX3 CLSR3
TTL:
        if (V2 < V1) @{
        goto L2;@}
        return(V3);
L2:
        @{ int V5;
          V5 = LI1((V1)-1,V2,V3);
        @{ int V6;
          V6 = LI1((V2)-1,V3,V1);
          V3 = LI1((V3)-1,V1,V2);
          V2 = V6;
          V1 = V5;@}@}
        goto TTL;

@node Embedding C code, The C language interface, Inspecting generated C code, The compiler
@section Embedding C code in lisp source

There are several mechanism to integrate C code within @ecl{}, but
everything is built around two functions that allow the user to embed
arbitrary C/C++ code into Lisp source code.

The two mechanisms are the @code{Clines} and the @code{c-inline} special
forms. The first one permits to insert code in the intermediate C/C++ file
generated by the @ecl{} compiler. Such a form outputs no value and takes
no arguments, except a series of strings which are inserted literally,
such as @code{#include} or @code{#define} statements, function definitions, etc.

@defmac {Clines} @{@{string@}*@}
When the @ecl{} compiler encounters a macro form @code{(Clines @var{string1
...  stringn})}, it simply outputs the @var{strings} into the c-file.  The
arguments are not evaluated and each argument must be a string.  Each
@var{string} may consist of any number of lines, and separate lines in the
@var{string} are placed in separate lines in the c-file.  In addition, each
@var{string} opens a fresh line in the c-file, i.e., the first character in the
@var{string} is placed at the first column of a line.  Therefore, C-language
preprocessor commands such as @code{#define} and @code{#include} will be
recognized as such by the C compiler, if the ' # ' sign appears as the first
character of the @var{string} or as the first character of a line within the
@var{string}.

When interpreted, a @code{Clines} macro form expands to @nil{}.

@end defmac

@lisp
(use-package "FFI")

(Clines
"   int tak(x, y, z)                       "
"   int x, y, z;                           "
"   @{   if (y >= x) return(z);             "
"       else return(tak(tak(x-1, y, z),    "
"                       tak(y-1, z, x),    "
"                       tak(z-1, x, y)));  "
"   @}                                      "
)

(defun tak (x y z)
  (c-inline (x y z) (:int :int :int) :int
     "tak(#0,#1,#2)" :one-liner t))
@end lisp

The second mechanism, which you already appreciate in the example above, is the
@code{c-inline} special form. This powerful method allows the user to insert C
code which is evaluated, and which can accept values and return values from and
to the Lisp world, with an automatic convertion taking place in both directions.

@defmac {c-inline} @{@var{args-list} @var{arg-C-types} @var{output-C-type} @var{C-expr} @keys{} (@var{side-effects} @code{T}) (@var{one-liner} @code{T})@}

@code{c-inline} is a special form that can only be used in compiled
code.  For all purposes it behaves as a Lisp form, which takes the
arguments given in @var{args-list} and produces a single value. Behind
the curtains, the arguments of @var{args-list} (which can be any valid
Lisp form) are coerced to the the C types given in @var{arg-C-types},
passed to the C expression @var{C-expr}, and coerced back to Lisp
using the C type @var{output-C-type} as a guide.  Multiple return
values can be returned by setting @var{output-C-type} to @code{(values
type-1 type-2 ...)}.

@var{C-expr} is a string containing C code and maybe some special
escape codes.  First, the arguments of the form may be retrieved as
@code{#0}, @code{#1}, etc.  Second, if the @code{c-inline} form is a
one-line C expression (That is, @var{one-liner} is true), then the
whole expression is interpreted as the output value. But if the code,
on the other hand, is a multiline expression (@var{one-liner} is
false), the form has to be output using @code{@@(return)
=...}. Multiple values are returned as @code{@@(return 0)=... ;
@@(return 1)=...;}. Finally, Lisp constants may be used in the C code
making use of the prefix @code{@@}.

@lisp
(use-package "FFI")

(Clines "
#include <math.h>

double foo (double x, double y) @{
  return sinh(x) * y;
@}")

(defvar *a*
  (c-inline (1.23) (:double) :double
    "foo(#0,1.44)"
    :side-effects nil
    :one-liner t))

(defvar *b*
  (c-inline (1.23) (:double) :double
       "@{cl_object x = symbol_value(@@*a*);
	@@(return) = foo(#0,object_to_float(x));@}"
    :side-effects nil
    :one-liner nil))

@node The C language interface, The old C language interface, Embedding C code, The compiler
@section The C language interface

Using these special forms @code{clines} and @code{c-inline}, plus the ability to
handle pointers to foreign data, we have built a rather complete FFI for
interfacing with the C world. This interface is compatible with the UFFI
specification, which can be found in the web. We recommend you to grab the
documentation from this package and read it carefully. All examples should
run unmodified under @ecl{} (Of course, you do not need to download UFFI
itself, as everything is already implemented in @ecl{}.

However, because @ecl{} provides some additional functionality which escapes the
UFFI, and also for compatibility with older versions of the @ecl{} environment,
we provide additional toplevel forms, which are listed in the next section.


@node The old C language interface,  , The C language interface, The compiler
@section The old C language interface

In this section we list several macros and toplevel forms which are provided
either for convenience or for compatibility with older versions of @ecl{}.
You should avoid using them when the UFFI-compatible interface provides
similar functionality.

We define some terminology here which is used throughout this Chapter. A
@emph{C-id} is either a Lisp string consisting of a valid C-language
identifier, or a Lisp symbol whose print-name, with all its alphabetic
characters turned into lower case, is a valid C identifier.  Thus the symbol
@code{foo} is equivalent to the string @code{"foo"} when used as a C-id.
Similarly, a @emph{C-expr} is a string that may be regarded as a
C-language expression.  A @emph{C-type} is one of the Lisp symbols
@code{:int, :char, :float, :double,...} and @code{:object}. 
Each corresponds to a data type in the C language; @code{:object} is
the type of Lisp object and other C-types are primitive data types in C.

@defmac {defentry} @{@var{function} @var{parameter-list} @var{C-function}@}

@code{defentry} defines a Lisp function whose body consists of the calling
sequence to a C-language function. @var{function} is the name of the Lisp
function to be defined, and @var{C-function} specifies the C function to be
invoked. @var{C-function} must be either a list @code{(@var{type C-id})} or
@var{C-id}, where @var{type} and @var{C-id} are the type and the name of the C
function. @var{type} must be a C-type or the symbol @code{void} which means
that the C function returns no value.  @code{(object @var{C-id})} may be
abbreviated as @var{C-id}.  @var{parameter-list} is a list of C-types for the
parameters of the C function.  For example, the following @code{defentry} form
defines a Lisp function @code{tak} from which the C function @code{tak} above
is called.

@end defmac

@lisp
(defentry tak (:int :int :int) (:int tak))
@end lisp

The Lisp function @code{tak} defined by this @code{defentry} form requires
three arguments.  The arguments are converted to @code{int} values before they
are passed to the C function.  On return from the C function, the returned
@code{int} value is converted to a Lisp integer (actually a fixnum) and this
fixnum will be returned as the value of the Lisp function.  See below for type
conversion between Lisp and the C language.

A @code{defentry} form is treated in the above way only when it appears as a
top-level form of a Lisp source file.  Otherwise, a @code{defentry} form
expands to @nil{}.

@defmac {defla} @{name lambda-list @{declaration | doc-string@}*@}

When interpreted, @code{defla} is exactly the same as @code{defun}.  That is,
@code{(defla @var{name lambda-list .  body})} expands to @code{(defun @var{name
lambda-list .  body})}.  However, @code{defla} forms are completely ignored by
the compiler; no C-language code will be generated for @code{defla} forms.  The
primary use of @code{defla} is to define a Lisp function in two ways within a
single Lisp source file; one in the C language and the other in Lisp.
@code{defla} is short for @emph{DEF}ine @emph{L}isp @emph{A}lternative.
@end defmac

Suppose you have a Lisp source file whose contents are:

@lisp
(use-package "FFI")

;;; C version of TAK.
(Clines "

       int tak(x, y, z)                           
       int x, y, z;
       @{      if (y >= x) return(z);
               else return(tak(tak(x-1, y, z),
                               tak(y-1, z, x),
                               tak(z-1, x, y)));
       @}
"
)

;;;  TAK calls the C function tak defined above.
(defentry tak (:int :int :int) (:int tak))
;;;  The alternative Lisp definition of TAK.
(defla tak (x y z)
   (if (>= y x)
       z
       (tak (tak (1- x) y z)
            (tak (1- y) z x)
            (tak (1- z) x y))))
@end lisp

When this file is loaded into @ecl{}, the interpreter uses the Lisp version of
the @code{tak} definition.  Once this file has been compiled, and when the
generated fasl file is loaded into @ecl{}, a function call to @code{tak} is
actually the call to the C version of @code{tak}.

@defun {defCbody} {name args-types result-type C-expr}
The @ecl{} compiler produces a function named @var{name} with as many
arguments as @var{arg-types}.  The @var{C-expr} is an arbitrary C expression
where the arguments to the function are denoted by @code{#@emph{i}}, where
@code{@emph{i}} is the integer corresponding to the argument position.  The
@var{args-types} is the list of @clisp types of the arguments to the function,
while @var{result-type} is the @clisp type of the result.  The actual arguments
are coerced to the required types before executing the @var{C-expr} and the
result is converted into a Lisp object.  @code{defCbody} is ignored by the
interpreter.
@end defun

For example, the logical AND of two integers could be defined as:
@lisp
(defCbody logand (fixnum fixnum) fixnum "(#0) & (#1)")
@end lisp

@defun {definline} @{name args-types result-type C-expr@}
@code{definline} behaves exactly as @code{defCbody}.  Moreover, after a
@code{definline} definition has been supplied, the @ecl{} compiler will expand
inline any call to function @var{name} into code corresponding to the C
language expression @var{C-expr}, provided that the actual arguments are of the
specified type.  If the actual arguments cannot be coerced to those types, the
inline expansion is not performed.  @code{definline} is ignored by the
interpreter.

@end defun

For example, a function to access the n-th byte of a string and return it as an
integer can be defined as follows:

@lisp
(definline aref-byte (string fixnum) fixnum
   "(#0)->ust.ust_self[#1]")
@end lisp

The definitions of the C data structures used to represent \clisp objects can
be found in file @code{ecl.h} in the directory @code{"src/h"} of the source
distribution.

@ecl{} converts a Lisp object into a C-language data by using the @clisp{}
function @code{coerce}: For the C-type @code{int} (or @code{char}), the object
is first coerced to a Lisp integer and the least significant 32-bit (or 8-bit)
field is used as the C @code{int} (or @code{char}).  For the C-type
@code{float} (or @code{double}), the object is coerced to a single-float (or a
double-float) and this value is used as the @code{C float} (or @code{double}).
Conversion from a C data into a Lisp object is obvious: @code{C char, int,
float,} and @code{double} become the equivalent Lisp @code{character},
@code{fixnum}, @code{single-float}, and @code{double-float}, respectively.

Here we list the complete syntax of @code{Clines}, @code{defentry},
@code{definline} and @code{defCbody} macro forms.
