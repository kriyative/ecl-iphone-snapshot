The configuration and build scripts for this package were generated by
automake/autoconf.  "configure --prefix=<install dir>; make; make install"
in this directory should work.

Note that much of the content of this library is in the header files.

However two small libraries are built and installed:

- libatomic_ops.a is a support library, which is not needed on some platforms.
  This is intended to be usable, under some mild restrictions, in free or
  proprietary code, as are all the header files.  See doc/LICENSING.txt.
- libatomic_ops_gpl.a contains some higher level facilities.  This code is
  currently covered by the GPL.  The contents currently correspond to
  the headers atomic_ops_stack.h and atomic_ops_malloc.h.
