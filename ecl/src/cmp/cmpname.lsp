;;;; CMPNAME Unambiguous init names for object files
;;;;
;;;; Every object file in a lisp library or combined FASL (such as the
;;;; compiler), needs a function that creates its data and installs the
;;;; functions. This initialization function has a C name which needs
;;;; to be unique. This file has functions to create such names.
