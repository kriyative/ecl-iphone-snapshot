The copies of asdf.lisp and README in this directory are complete and 
unchanged from the canonical cCLan CVS.  They may lag the CVS version 
by a few revisions (but shouldn't usually) but unless we've fouled up
horribly, are not forked.

The README file thus applies in its entirety apart from the scary 
warnings about making sure you have the right version and it has not
been mutilated
